        <h2><em>About</em></h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Eddie Hesketh.</p>
        <p>
          I'm a second-year Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student at the University of Adelaide. Currently, I'm in the interview process with several companies, aiming to secure a tech internship starting in November 2025.

          When I'm not behind my computer, you’ll likely find me playing or watching football, bouldering with friends in the evening, or planning my next snowboarding trip.
        </p>
        <p>I have a keen interest in artificial intelligence, which I’ve been fortunate to explore as a research assistant at the Australian Institute of Machine Learning. There, I’m working on a project using vision-language models to classify musculoskeletal diseases, combining my passion for AI with impactful real-world applications.</p>
