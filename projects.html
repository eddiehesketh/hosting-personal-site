        <p>Welcome to my project portfolio.</p>
        <p>
          Over my first year of university, I developed a keen interest in the
          world of trading and the stock market, exploring how programming can
          be used to enhance the process. This passion led to the creation of a
          MATLAB-based program for cryptocurrency analysis, as well as a group
          C++ project focused on testing stock investment strategies using data
          from over 20 Fortune 500 companies, both of which are discussed below.

        <p>
          I developed a program to analyze over 100 cryptocurrencies in
          real-time with data pulled from Coin Market Cap’s API. This tool
          allowed users to test various moving average strategies with a set
          investment amount, helping identify the most profitable combinations
          using historical and live data. Key features included strategy
          optimization, profit measurement, and an interactive user interface.

        </h3>
        <p>
          As part of a large group project, I contributed to the development of
          a C++ platform designed to simulate stock investment strategies on
          data from over 20 Fortune 500 companies. The simulator supported
          strategies such as set deposits, dividend reinvestment, a moving
          average crossover strategy, and momentum-based investing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project utilized object-oriented programming principles like
          inheritance and polymorphism, with a graphical user interface
          providing seamless navigation, graphical analysis, and price tracking.
          This collaborative effort not only showcased our technical skills but
          also provided a real-world context for exploring investment
          approaches.

            >Medical Report Analysis Automation | <em>Python 3</em></a
          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          In my role as a Research Assistant at the Australian Institute of
          Machine Learning, myself and a partner developed a Python tool to
          process and summarize over 260,000 medical reports. Each X-ray used to
          train the vision-language model (VLM) required an accompanying text
          description, enabling the model to understand and interpret image
          data. Since medical reports are often written in shorthand by doctors,
          the challenge was to structure the information into clear,
          descriptive, and accurate summaries suitable for training the VLM.
        </p>
        <p>
          To achieve this, we utilized NVIDIA’s llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct
          LLM to generate precise and coherent outputs. This automation not only
          enhanced the dataset’s quality but also streamlined the preparation of
          training data, ultimately advancing the model’s capability to perform
          AI-assisted diagnostics effectively.
